You should apply when you arrive in the UK or as soon as you think it would be unsafe for you to return to your own country. Your application is more likely to be denied if you wait. When you apply you\u2019ll have a meeting with an immigration officer (known as a \u2018screening\u2019). After your screening the Home Office will decide if your claim can be considered in the UK.
